# Web3-Truffle

```shell
This repository contains simple contracts which made use of Web3.js library to interact with Ethereum blockchain and perform some transactions.

I made two independent javascript files : balance.js and transaction.js which used web3.js library :
- to get the balance of my accounts on Rinkeby testnet and 
- to send some ethers from one account to another. 

I also made one initial.sol file and its javascript file initial.js to compile and deploy it using web3.js and truffle(HDWalletProvider).
